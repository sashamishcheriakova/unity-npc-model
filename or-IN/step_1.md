Navigate to the model you want to use in the Project window and drag the model into your Scene view.

If your model has associated child GameObjects, you can enable and disable them using the checkbox next to their name in the Inspector window.

You can customise your character by dragging 'Materials' onto the GameObjects in the Scene view. This example uses the Cat model with a white 'Snow' material instead of its usual material:
